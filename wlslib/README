	This library contains support routines used by Ruby programs
accessing the CloudPassage Halo API.  It should be placed in the same
directory as those programs (such as /usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/ ).

	In addition to Ruby, this library and the tools built on it
require a number of Ruby gems.  The following command will install all
optional gems needed by the CloudPasssage API clients:

sudo gem install oauth2 rest-client json public_suffix ip

	Questions about the library should be sent to its author,
William Stearns, wstearns@cloudpassage.com .
