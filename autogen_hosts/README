We have a centralized syslog host.  Since we generally don't maintain
reverse dns for our servers, we end up with the log files generated by
syslog named after IP addresses, which makes it harder for us to figure out
who is generating what.

But if you generate an /etc/hosts from the hosts in CloudPassage, you can fix
all that and make it so that most things are named properly!  This presumes
that you set your hostnames properly.  AWS doesn't do that by default, though
that is easily fixed if you are using something like RightScale to manage them.

Files:
	install.sh: copies files in place.
	hosts.rb: This script dumps an /etc/hosts file out to stdout using
		the oauth2 gem to get the session key
	hosts2.rb: This script dumps an /etc/hosts file out to stdout using
		a basic rest-client interface.
	hostsupdate.cron: This is the cron job that runs every 30 minutes

The install.sh script is an excerpt from one of our RightScale scripts
that we use to install the syslog server.  You will also have to go edit
the hosts.rb script to have the proper keyid and secret key.

Anyways, this isn't perfect, but it's probably good enough to give you ideas.

Have fun!
