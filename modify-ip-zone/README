======== Step by step setup.

- You should have the Ruby language interpreter already installed.

- You should also have the following ruby gems installed: oauth2,
  rest-client, json, date, and optparse.  The following command will
  install all optional gems needed by the CloudPasssage API clients:
  sudo gem install oauth2 rest-client json public_suffix ip

- Copy modify-ip-zone.rb and wlslib.rb to the same directory in your
path.  Both are available at http://www.stearns.org/halo-api/ . 
wlslib.rb will also be found if you copy it to any directory in your
ruby library search path, which can be seen by running
echo 'puts $:' | irb

- In the Halo portal (
https://portal.cloudpassage.com/firewall_zones/new ), create an IP zone
called fail2ban-ssh .  Give it a dummy address of 169.254.255.255 and press create.

- Now configure your firewall policy.  You may want to test this on a
test server before committing to a production machine.  Create any rules
for authorized ssh users first so you can be sure they can get in even
if fail2ban mistakenly adds one of their addresses.  Below those rules,
add a rule with a source of the "fail2ban-ssh" IP zone, a service of
"ssh" and Action DROP.

- If you do not already have a Full Access API key, create one at
https://portal.cloudpassage.com/settings/users#api_keys .  Press "Add
new key", give it a descriptive name such as "Zone modification", and
make sure to change the Permission to "Full Access" (a read-only API key
can read a zone, but not change it).  Edit /etc/halo-api-keys on the
system that will run this script and add your key on its own line.  The
line should look like:

8_char_key_id|32_char_secret_key

The Key ID is directly visible at
https://portal.cloudpassage.com/settings/users#api_keys .  To see the
Secret Key, press Show to the right of the Key ID.  The character in
between the ID and the Secret Key is a vertical pipe, above the
backslash on a US keyboard.  Example:

aabb3344|0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210

- Check ownership and permissions on /etc/halo-api-keys .  The file
should be owned by the user running the script and mode 600.

- Finally, modify the configuration of fail2ban so that it stops making
changes to the firewall directly, and instead calls out to external
programs to add and remove addresses.  Those commands will be the
following, respectively:
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh -a <ip>
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh -r <ip>

- To see addresses as they're added, you can refresh the following URL:
https://portal.cloudpassage.com/firewall_zones

- If you're ever concerned that this zone is interfering with normal
ssh, edit any firewall policies using this zone and uncheck the "Active"
box to the left of any firewall rules using this zone.  When you save
your changes, new firewalls will be pushed out to these servers. 
Remember to re-activate after troubleshooting is complete.

======== Notes:
- Note that by using a centralized zone as we are here, a single
instance of fail2ban can feed an ssh blacklist into a firewall that's
fed to an entire group of machines.

- Instances of fail2ban on multiple machines can all use this software
to update the IP zone simultaneously (no machine keeps the list locally;
we pull the zone down and modify it before sending it back up each
time).

- You can run this script by hand to manually add or remove addresses.

- The zone you attempt to create must have at least 1 and no more than
375 addresses per Halo portal zone limits.  If you need more than 375
addresses, break the list up into 375 address or less chunks and create 
multiple zones.

#Examples:

#To see the command line help
modify-ip-zone.rb -h

#To add an address to a zone:
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh -a 6.7.8.9

#To remove an address from a zone:
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh -r 6.7.8.9

#You can add and remove multiple addresses with one invocation:
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh -a 9.8.7.6/28 -a 1.1.2.2/30 -r 3.5.7.9

#To ignore the current contents of the zone and start off with an empty list:
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh --empty -a 9.8.7.6/28

#To add a list of addresses, one per line, from stdin:
echo -e '169.254.0.1\n169.254.1.0/24' | ./modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh --empty --add-stdin

#To remove a list of addresses supplied on stdin:
echo -e '169.254.0.1' | ./modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z fail2ban-ssh --remove-stdin

#If your zone has spaces or other characters that might be processed by the shell, surround it with quotes:
modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z '|My Very odd zone|!!' -r 6.7.8.9

#Example of loading a public blacklist into an IP zone
curl -s -o - https://isc.sans.edu/block.txt | sed -e 's/#.*//' | egrep -v '(^$|^Start)' | awk '{print $1 "/" $3}' | ./modify-ip-zone.rb -i aabb3344 -z isc-blocklist --empty --add-stdin
