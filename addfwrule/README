There comes a time when you need to add a rule to all your firewall policies.
If you have many firewall policies, this is very tedious to do!  I wrote
this script to do this automatically using the CloudPassage API.  It's
a bit simple, but it suited my needs.  You can probably adapt it to
whatever your particular needs are pretty easily by editing the json.

Note:  As is, this works only for linux firewalls.  To make it work with
windows firewalls, you will need to get rid of the "position" entry at a
minimum.

Have fun!
